	Abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The idea of a finite collection of closed sets having  '' linearly regular intersection'' at a point is crucial in variational analysis. This central theoretical condition also has striking algorithmic consequences: in the case of two sets, one of which satisfies a further regularity condition (convexity or smoothness, for example), we prove that von Neumann's method of  '' alternating projections'' converges locally to a point in the intersection, at a linear rate associated with a modulus of regularity. As a consequence, in the case of several arbitrary closed sets having linearly regular intersection at some point, the method of  '' averaged projections'' converges locally at a linear rate to a point in the intersection. Inexact versions of both algorithms also converge linearly.},
